TITLE AMPA and NMDA receptor with presynaptic short-term plasticity 


COMMENT
AMPA and NMDA receptor conductance using a dual-exponential profile
presynaptic short-term plasticity based on Fuhrmann et al. 2002
Implemented by Srikanth Ramaswamy, Blue Brain Project, July 2009
GUY: Removed  plasticity and depression

COMMENT
The Verbatim block is needed to generate random nos. from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 
for comparison with Pr to decide whether to activate the synapse or not
