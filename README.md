# NeMo-TMS
## Multi-Scale Neuron Modeling
A comprehensive tutorial will be added after completing the developments.

A lot of the procedure is similar to the previous version. As a summary, for the Jarsky model (CA1 cell), go to **Model_Generation\Jarsky files\lib_mech** and compile the mod files. Then run **Model_Generation\Jarsky_model.m** in Matlab for model generation. 
The generated model is placed in **Models\Model_Name**. All the necessary source code for running the model and their corresponding output data can be found in **Models\Model_Name\Code** and **Models\Model_Name\Results** respectively. All the steps are either similar to before, or (hopefully) self explanatory.

We're still working on Eyal model (cortical cell), so ignore it.
