% DISSECT_TREE   Groups together nodes belonging to same branches.
% (trees package)
%
% [sect, vec] = dissect_tree (intree, options)
% --------------------------------------------
%
% Groups segments together which belong to same branches to be used as
% sections in NEURON-like compartmental modeling. Branches are defined as
% being separated by either branching or termination nodes or
% region-defined borders. To simplify a tree to its dissected version
% delete all continuation points with:
% "delete_tree (tree, find (C_tree (tree))".
% 
% Input
% -----
% - intree   ::integer:      index of tree in trees or structured tree
% - options  ::string:
%     '-s'   : show branches
%     '-r'   : do not section by region
%     {DEFAULT: ''}
%
% Output
% ------
% - sect     ::two-column vector: 1. starting node 2. ending node
% - vec      ::optional vector Nx2: attributes to each element a branch
%     index and a path length value [in um] within the given section
%
% NOTE! this function isn't completely correct yet at the root!
%
% Example
% -------
% sect         = dissect_tree (sample_tree, '-s')
